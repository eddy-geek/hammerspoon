# Hammerspoon Configuration

This repository contains a personal Hammerspoon configuration for macOS automation.

The main goals are:

1. Provide a keyboard & shortcut experience which is closer to Linux(/Windows) ones.
2. Provide dedicated quick app-switching functionality. I first started doing this on Windows with AutoHotkey, then on KDE Linux with KWin scripts.

Of all the tools available (see the keyboard flow [docs](docs/macos-keyboard-input-handling.md))
I am trying to stick
 to
 * hidutil (low-level key remapping, eg modifiers and F-keys)
 * custom keyboard layout (for accents, compose key)
 * Hammerspoon (for most shortcuts and automation)
 
 Notably I am skipping Karabiner as it is heavy and can have compatibility issues ([Karabiner-Elements#3708](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/3708)).

## Dependencies

To make the experience closer to Linux, I am remapping the keys in the main MacOS hardware keyboard (in *Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Modifier keys*) as follows:

```
Before:   üåê  ^  ‚å•  ‚åò   (Fn     Control Option  Command)
After :   ‚åò  üåê  ^  ‚å•   (Command   Fn   Control  Option)
```

On typical external Windows keyboards, it issimpler as only Command (Windows logo) and Control need to be swapped. When using Keychron keyboard which have a MacOS mode, I leave them in Windows mode.

```
Before:   ^   ‚äû = ‚åò   ‚å•    (Control ; Windows == Command ; Alt == Option)
After :   ‚åò     ^     ‚å•    (Command      Control  Option)
```

(Note that this remapping has to be done for each external keyboard you connect, unless you use a separate tool like Karabiner-Elements)



## Hotkeys

## Key Remappings

Swapping Command and Control is the easiest solutions since it covers the many app-specific hotkeys, but it is a bit too extreme, so some things need to be "swapped back" with those remappings:

This configuration also includes the following key remappings to provide a more consistent experience:

- `Cmd + Tab` is remapped to `Ctrl + Tab` for application switching together with `Cmd + Shift + Tab`.
- `Cmd + Left/Right Arrow` behavior is swapped with `Option + Left/Right Arrow` for text navigation.
- `Cmd + Delete` behavior is swapped with `Option + Delete`.

## Future Improvements

* Fix terminal as it is using Ctrl for special characters, conflicting with my app focus hotkeys.
* Use of spoons
